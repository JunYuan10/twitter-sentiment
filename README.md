Project Objective
I write crawler program to collect tweets of users based on Twitter API, then use database to store and manage these data.
I am going to build a classifier to predict sentiment in each tweet, which means I  classify each tweet as positive or negative in this project.
Then I want to use this classifier to predict how people are responding to different topics.
